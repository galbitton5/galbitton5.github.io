Hello!

I am a doctoral candidate in the [School of Political Science at Tel Aviv University](https://en-social-sciences.tau.ac.il/poli-eng), and am honored to be an [Azrieli Graduate Fellow](https://azrielifoundation.org/fellows/directory/). During 2021-2022, I was a predoctoral fellow at the [Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Tel Aviv University](https://en-ethics.tau.ac.il/Fellows_Academic_Program/?tab=5).

I specialize in political economy, with a primary emphasis on financial decision-making processes and voter attitudes towards redistribution policies. Additionally, within the realm of international political economy, I delve into topics such as currency internationalization and financial liberalization. I also investigate the politics of welfare deservingness and the nuances of Eurosceptic sentiments. From a methodological standpoint, my interests lie in survey and field experimentation, crafting survey designs, and conducting extensive data analysis.
