Hello!

I am a doctoral candidate in the [School of Political Science at Tel Aviv University](https://en-social-sciences.tau.ac.il/poli-eng), and am honored to be an [Azrieli Graduate Fellow](https://azrielifoundation.org/fellows/directory/). During 2021-2022, I was a predoctoral fellow at the [Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Tel Aviv University](https://en-ethics.tau.ac.il/Fellows_Academic_Program/?tab=5).

I specialize in international political economy, focusing on financial decision-making and policymaking. My research addresses topics such as financial liberalization, cultural finance, and voter attitudes toward redistribution policies. I tend to take a multi-level approach, using micro-level insights to explain macro-level phenomena, bridging individual behaviors with broader economic and political trends.

More broadly, I am interested in political economy, political behavior, and voting preferences. Methodologically, my work emphasizes experimental and observational methods, survey design, and in-depth data analysis.
