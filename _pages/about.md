Hello!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University](https://www.wcfia.harvard.edu) and an [Azrieli Fellow](https://azrielifoundation.org/fellows/directory/). I earned my PhD in Political Science from Tel Aviv University in January 2025.

I specialize in international political economy, focusing on financial decision-making and policymaking. My research addresses topics such as financial liberalization, cultural finance, and voter attitudes toward redistribution policies. I take a multi-level approach, using micro-level insights to explain macro-level phenomena, bridging individual behaviors with broader economic and political trends.

More broadly, I am interested in political economy, political behavior, and voting preferences. Methodologically, my work emphasizes experimental and observational methods, survey design, and in-depth data analysis.
