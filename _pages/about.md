Hello!

I am a doctoral student in the School of Political Science at Tel Aviv University. 

I specialize in political economy, with a primary emphasis on financial decision-making processes and voter attitudes towards redistribution policies. Additionally, within the realm of international political economy, I delve into topics such as currency internationalization and financial liberalization. I also investigate the politics of welfare deservingness and the nuances of Eurosceptic sentiments. From a methodological standpoint, my interests lie in survey and field experimentation, crafting survey designs, and conducting extensive data analysis.
